Makina Collect
==============

This application is based on the open-source app ODK Collect from the Open Data Kit tool suite
([http://opendatakit.org](http://opendatakit.org)).
Makina Collect is meant to collect data of diverse types and fill forms or surveys on the field with
an android device. Data can be made of text, numbers, photos, audio, video, geographic data, barcodes...
Forms and questions can take several appearances chosen by the creator of the form.
Data of type location can be acquired through the device geolocation system (using GPS or network) or set by the user on the map.
This application can be used with a server such as Formhub or ODK Aggregate.

Bug reports and demands for features can be posted on the [project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/makinacorpus/MakinaCollect).
